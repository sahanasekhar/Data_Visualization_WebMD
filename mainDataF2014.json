But if you wish to read on,\n I will honestly try to provide you with some details as they relate to Pancreatic Cancer survival rates. This stage of pancreatic cancer is classified as Stage 1V( B) because it has spread to the liver and other organs. It presents with the grimmest prognosis. Life expectancy is individualized based upon the degree of metastasis and the patients overall health. According to some medical studies,\n your sister may have only days,\n weeks,\n or several months for survival. Some cases of lasting at least a year have been known to happen,\n but are considered to be rare. The 5 year survival rate is listed as less than 1%. Hospice care sounds like a solid plan that will ensure that your sister's needs are well satisfied. Since treating the cancer is no longer a viable option,\n palliative care will be started to ensure that your sister always remains comfortable and as pain-free as humanly possible. Now is the time for you and your family to galvanize around each other and to celebrate your sisters life. It is a time to reflect on your wonderful life together.The sibling relationship is very strong as it usually represents the longest time that we are bound on earth to any one particular relative. I suggest the following actions for you to consider: Visit your sister frequently; listen to her wishes and her concerns,\n talk about the good times,\n and embrace each other tightly. Then each evening go home,\n talk with friends and family as you feel up to it,\n eat all of your meals,\n say a nightly prayer,\n and rest well. Above all your sister surely wants you to stay well.

A federal law was passed in 1979 requiring manufacturers of medications to assign product expiration dates. This date was intended to provide the consumer with a time deadline that ensured full potency and drug safety. Sometime after creating the 1979 law,\n a study was reported to have occurred by the FDA in response to a U.S. military quandary. The government maintained (and probably still does) a large stockpile of expensive medications (prescription and over-the counter types) and had to dispose of and replace these drugs every few years. The results of the study showed that 90% of the more than 100 drugs looked at were absolutely safe and effective for usage even after 15 years past their assigned expiration date. Many pharmacologic experts believe that expired drugs are safe to take,\n even those that expired some years ago. Although the potency of a drug may decrease over time,\n much of the original potency still remains intact even a decade after the expiration date. With the possible exceptions of insulin,\n liquid antibiotics,\n and nitroglycerin,\n most medications have long shelf lives just as the ones tested by the FDA for the military. If the medication is stored in a dry,\n cool,\n and darkened container,\n its potency and overall safety should remain for years beyond the stamped manufactures expiration date. There are many anecdotal web accountings swearing that just about all medications are still safe and effective well beyond the expiration date stamped on their bottle or box. Even my bottle of spring water that was purchased last week shows a stamp text indicating... Best By 04/08/16. I know that water is not the same as medication,\n but Id drink that unopened bottle of water after 4/8/16 and use the past expiration Xanax pills. I'd fully expect to experience no negative consequences. I am not saying to stock-pile medications for usage beyond their expiration dates. Admittedly when possible,\n it is a good practice to follow the manufacturers expiration date and throw-out outdated medications. But in a pinch,\n using medications past their expiration dates for a brief period of time should not present a health danger. It is also important to realize that at best these dates may be well intended,\n but perhaps arbitrarily assigned without sufficient scientific testing.

Cirrhosis of the liver generally shortens life expectancy sometimes greatly. There are 4 stages of liver cirrhosis.

These positive changes may include improved dietary habits and drinking cessation. The tricks to living a longer life with this disease include early diagnosis and arresting the amount of liver damage thereby maintaining maximum remaining liver function. Physicians use a relatively simple formula to determine life expectancy for individuals afflicted with this disease. Five different factors including liver enzyme testing (e.g. Bilirubin),\n fluid about the liver,\n and hepatic enlargement are rated from 1 (minimal imbalance) to 3 (maximum imbalance). The five numbers are combined for a final score to arrive at a scientific range\" of remaining life expectancy. As you can see,\n determining life expectancy with liver cirrhosis is a process based upon the stage of development at first discovery,\n individual scoring of the 5 liver functioning factors,\n individual commitment to making positive lifestyle changes,\n and your age and overall general health. The course of the disease progresses as follows: stage 1 (either no symptoms or few symptoms such as fatigue and abdominal swelling),\n stage 2 (hardening of liver tissue),\n stage 3 (damage to liver functioning),\n stage 4 (terminal).

However there are two things that you need to take into consideration when you are thinking about anal sex. Although the chances of becoming pregnant through anal sex are very slim it does not mean to say that it is impossible.There are the risky chances that your boyfriend could ejaculate just outside of your anus or even if he does ejaculate inside the anus,\nsemen could possibly leak out and find its way into your vagina. Again becoming pregnant from a single sperm has a very slim chance however it is not impossible. Therefore if you are not looking to become pregnant it is advised that you use some sort of protection but the protection used is entirely up to you and your partner. (NOTE: If you decide to use a condom then you need to be seriously careful as the condom has an increased risk of breaking through anal sex as it can be quite tight) But becoming pregnant should not be your only worry when you are thinking about having anal sex. Whilst the chances of becoming pregnant through anal sex are slim compared to the chances of vaginal sex,\nthe risk of Sexually Transmitted Diseases/Sexually Transmitted Infections are very high the reason for this is that the friction with the additional tightness in anal sex can often lead to cuts,\nlacerations and bleeding that combined with seminal and other body fluids can lead to discomfort and serious infections such as HIV,\n Gonorrhoea and chlamydia. If you have already had anal sex then I suggest you take an immediate trip to your doctor and arrange for a physical check up for any STD's. However if you have not already had anal sex then some serious advice from me would be to just stick with vaginal sex as you can use protection without high risks of failure and also you will have reduced risks of catching anything especially if you are using protection such as condoms. It is also advised that once you have become sexually active in any sort of way (oral sex,\n anal sex and vaginal sex) you have a check up at least once a year for any possible STD's however it may be wise to have check ups when you change your partner in a relationship. This is not to cause embarrassment but it is for the importance for your own safety and those around you. I hope my answer has become of use and Good Luck.

In some small instances it can show the spine being pulled due to muscle spasms or as the previous poster said curvature of the spine. The only way an X-ray can be helpful,\n is if and only if you go back in 6 weeks and get another set done. it can show if there were a hairline fracture by new bone growth. ( Like any broken bone,\n it will grow back together in 6 weeks with extra bone present) Going later for the second set of xrays,\n the bone growth can beinterrupted as arthritis because the body will have bone growth after injury in a year to 16 months( osteophytes) to stabilize the spine. Lastly,\n if you haven't been diagnosed,\n I would defer going to a chiropractor.

In most cases this is simply a matter of basic biology. The body will do the best it can to provide supplies to meet environmental demands,\n but if there are more ejaculations than there is quality,\n rich semen,\n something thinner and clearer may be all thats available. In general,\n it takes about five hours for to body to rebuild sperm volume and semen nutrients after ejaculation. As such,\n men who discharge five or more times per day,\n or who do so in very close succession,\n may naturally notice clearer semen. So it could be the above,\n or,\n Over a longer period,\n however,\n uniformly clear semen could indicate a low sperm count,\n since sperm are one of the main things that contribute to semens somewhat cloudy appearance. Low sperm count is a clinical term used for men whose semen doesnt contain the usual number of sperm by volume. A normal count is usually between 20 to 150 million sperm cells per milliliter (7 grams) of sperm. Clear liquid often contains some ,\n but often not much . A thin texture to the semen is also a potential indication of a low sperm count,\n particularly if it is ejaculated without its customarily coagulated consistency. This isnt usually a problem from a health standpoint,\n but it can make impregnating a woman more difficult. OK so far the? Men who are worried are usually advised to speak with a qualified medical care provider,\n often a urologist. Urologists have expertise in the male reproductive system and fertility. Experts will usually start by running a semen analysis to measure the population and vitality of the mans sperm. He or she may urge a man with a low sperm count to change to a less acidic diet and abstain from masturbation,\n particularly if a baby is being planned. Do hope this helps you and hubby.

There can be hundreds of causes,\n involving nearly every body system,\n but commonly in the inner ear. Vertigo can also arise from the brain itself. The mechanism of vertigo is very complex. People with vertigo will tend to use words such as spinning,\n tilting,\n swaying,\n or rotating. Vertigo is a hallucination or feeling of movement. The most common type of vertigo is a sensation that a persons surroundings are spinning around them. A subjective sensation (the feeling that the patient himself is spinning) is also reported. The vertigo sensation most often arises from a part of the inner ear - the semicircular canals. Under normal conditions,\n the position and movements of the head are detected by tiny hair cells in the semicircular canals. Movements cause hair cells to transmit impulses to the brain. Calcium carbonate crystals or otoliths that are usually embedded in the membrane may occasionally float freely within the fluid of the semicircular canals. When free-floating crystals migrate to the far ends of the semicircular canal,\n these crystals cause a person to sense movement when there is none. The various tests that are performed (MRI,\n CT scans,\n ENG,\n etc.) are all important to help pinpoint the location of the problem. Unfortunately,\n a cause is often not found in many cases,\n so people (and their medical providers) are often left frustrated. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common cause of vertigo. The person usually describes bouts of recurring vertigo lasting several minutes or less. Episodes may be as brief as 15 seconds. Specific movements of the head often provoke the attack,\n usually following a brief delay of several seconds. Patients can often indicate the specific head motion or motions,\n which tend to trigger an attack. Nystagmus (the rapid twitching of the eyes) is often associated with the vertigo of BPPV. Hearing loss and tinnitus are not associated with BPPV. The second most common cause of vertigo is labyrinthitis ,\n also termed or vestibular neuritis. The disease is thought to be a sequel of a viral infection,\n like a simple cold or even the herpes virus. It is gradual in onset,\n reaches maximal intensity within one hour,\n and resolves within 24 hours. The episode is associated with nausea and vomiting. Hearing loss may or may not be seen. There is often a significant phase of dysequilibrium (balance problems) that may persist from days to months. Mnires disease,\n acoustic neuromas,\n medication side effects,\n otitis media (middle ear infections),\n sinusitis,\n migraines,\n trauma,\n brainstem dysfunction,\n multiple sclerosis,\n diabetes,\n reactive hypoglycemia,\n anemia,\n hypovolemia (loss of blood),\n hypoxia (low oxygen),\n hyperventilation syndrome,\n epilepsy,\n heart rhythm problems and other heart disease,\n and various neurological disorders all can cause vertigo. There are even psychogenic causes. Seeing a specialist that has some expertise in vertigo and balance disorders is often the best way to go. Many of these specialists are associated with large,\n university-based medical centers. I often recommend that patients have a consultation at this level.

This may be true,\n but the Feds; The Assistant Attorney General in fact,\n has stated they will not harass individuals who follow the rules of individual states,\n and to date,\n there has not been even one incident causing problems against people with state authority to use and grow Marijuana. 2: As a person living in daily pain,\n the pain clinic I treat with will not prescribe pain medications if I turn in a \"dirty\" UA. The funny thing here is I used for two weeks prior to my regular visit of eight weeks,\n and was told there was a problem with my pain meds use. I did not say anything believing I'd failed the UA somehow. She then revealed that I'd not used as many prescription meds as they thought I would have used. How dare I use something they do not approve of,\n and get more relief using MJ in conjunction with the Oxycontin and Hydrocodone. A few years ago,\n I was using 280 mg. of Morphine daily. Not long after being allowed Marijuana,\n medically,\n I asked to have this drug removed from my daily use,\n and be allowed something to use only when I was in severe pain. My doctor insisted I remain on 30 mg. at bedtime. 3: It harms the lungs. I already have severe COPD,\n but,\n instead of smoking my meds,\n I used a vaporizer. Granted,\n with my condition,\n it may do some harm,\n such as eating more and sleeping during the day. I'm sure these two \"side effects\" will kill me. 4: Ignorance. No further explanation needed.
