I read so many articles like this that my head was swimming. I knew I wasn't having a miscarriage,\n but what I was reading (all from credible sources btw) left me feeling like I was either doomed to miscarry,\n or I would be bed ridden. When I went in for an ultra sound the nurse pointed out a little dark area between the amniotic sac and my uterine wall. she said that is where the blood was coming from. At 7w1d I was still experiencing implantation bleeding- it was still attaching in an area. She said it is common,\n and everything was fine! I saw my little button wiggle,\n and we heard a heart beat! Baby measures perfectly. Not every story is going to end quite as uncomplicated,\n but I want women to have hope.

However,\n If the lump is painful and can be rolled around chances are,\n it may be a cyst of some kind and can be easily treated. I have a personal story: I had a horribly painful lump in my armpit and was more than frightened about the diagnosis of cancer. I did make an appointment with my physician and after a full examination of the area and an ultrasound,\n it was found that the area was a severely ingrown hair and the area had to be lanced and drained. Simple wound care was required for a couple of weeks following the procedure. Evidently,\n there is a large percentage of women who shave our underarms incorrectly. There is a name for these women. They are known as \"rakers\". A raker is someone that glides the razor over and around the underarm area in an irratic manner (across the direction of hair growth,\n against the direction of hair growth,\n whatever gets the job done) and it causes irritation or folliculitis (inflammation of the hair follicle) and even an ingrown hair (which can become extremely sore and enlarged due to the inflammation). The correct procedure for shaving your underarms is as follows: Start with wetting the underarm area with lukewarm water,\n apply shaving cream specific to the sensitive area of the underarm area and use a great quality razor (either disposable or reusable)- NEVER A DULL RAZOR! Always glide the razor WITH the direction of hair growth! This is information that you can use all the time,\n especially if those painful underarm lumps are diagnosed as being ingrown underarm hair. This is not to replace a visit or an examination by your physician.

It is applied topically to active canker sores for approximately 5-10 seconds. It seals individual lesions and resolves associated pain permanently. Research suggests that Debacterol may also speed healing of lesions. Rather than cauterization,\n benefits likely derive from its actions as a tissue denaturant. Debacterol is available to individuals by prescription for at-home use,\n or is offered as an in-office treatment by some medical and dental professionals. More information on can be found at Debacterol.com and EPIEN Medical. SILVER NITRATE Silver nitrate is a multi-purpose chemical cauterizing agent that can be used to seal acute canker sore lesions. It requires special storage due a highly reactive nature and is therefore for in-office use only. Silver nitrate should only be applied as an in-office treatment by medically trained individuals due to the risk of excessive tissue damage. It is not available by prescription. PAIN MANAGEMENT BENZOCAINE and MENTHOL Sometimes pain management for canker sores left to heal on their own is warranted. This is usually achieved with repeated application of compounds that contain nerve-numbing properties. Products containing Benzocaine (e.g.,\n Orajel,\n Orabase,\n Kanka) or Menthol (e.g.,\n Quantum Canker Cover) may help reduce pain with frequent application but do not speed healing. GELATIN Some medical products are designed to cover the lesion with Gelatin (e.g.,\n Canker Melts) and may provide some pain relief through increasing the barrier to mechanical irritation and bacteria. These options do not speed healing and require frequent application. HOME REMEDIES There are many web entries describing home remedies for the pain associated with canker sores including salt-water rinses,\n tea bags,\n aloe gel,\n baking soda and even ice. PREVENTION Frequent or severe canker sore outbreaks should be evaluated by a doctor because they may indicate a more severe condition requiring specific medical management (e.g.,\n Behcets Disease,\n PFAPA Syndrome). The efficacy of prevention techniques for uncomplicated canker sores is often debated,\n however these interventions may be helpful to some individuals: - Stress management - Avoid toothpaste with Sodium Lauryl Sulfate - Avoid highly acidic,\n rough or salty food - Decrease alcohol consumption - Decrease high carbohydrate foods. - Practice good moth hygiene - Address overt vitamin deficiencies (e.g.,\n iron,\n B12,\n folate) ", "questionId": "1172711", "memberFollowerNumber": 0, "memberDesc": null, "answerMemberId": "77455", "questionContent": "", "topicName": "pain", "answerVoteNum": 188, "questionTopicId": "canker-sore-questions", "topicVal": 0.5995250016525, "memberId": "77455", "questionTitle": "What is the treatment for canker sores?", "answerId": 5872, "memberHelpfulVotes": 222}, {"memberContact": null, "answerPostDate": "2013-01-24 18:36:02", "answerQuestionURL": "http://answers.webmd.com/answers/5009830/i-was-diagnosed-with-the-flu-have-been-on-tamiflu-for-3-days-now-am-i-still-contagious", "memberType": "Expert", "questionMemberId": "", "questionPostDate": "2012-12-26", "memberName": "Joseph Bresee", "questionURL": "http://answers.webmd.com/answers/5009830/i-was-diagnosed-with-the-flu-have-been-on-tamiflu-for-3-days-now-am-i-still-contagious", "memberWorkplace": "CDC", "memberJob": "Epidemiology", "answerHelpfulNum": 120, "answerContent": "Most healthy adults may be able to infect others from 1 day before symptoms start to 5 to 7 days after becoming sick,\n while children can spread virus for longer.

We have a lot of poison ivy both here in Michigan,\n and at my brother's house in Ohio,\n and the leaves are very much green except in the fall and winter,\n or if the summer weather is especially hot and dry,\n such as we had a few weeks ago. As soon as it cooled down a little and we got some rain,\n the leaves turned back to bright green again. I used to do tree work for a living,\n and I have seen individual vines as big as my arm. On one occasion,\n I had the unpleasant task of cutting down a poison ivy \"plant\" with over 40 large vines stemming from a trunk nearly six inches in diameter! Some of the leaves were almost as big as my hand! Despite all my precautions,\n I still ended up with a rash on most of both arms and on my face,\n and lost three days of work as a result. One of our other workers foolishly climbed a tree that had several vines on it,\n and he wound up in the emergency room the next day with a rash covering over 50% of his body. It is also important to bear in mind that the oil from the plants can remain active for up to two years on other surfaces that it does not bond with (such as shoes,\n gloves,\n and tools),\n and the oil on the plants themselves remains active for the same period even if the plants have been killed. So even after using an herbicide to kill them,\n you must take just as much care to avoid contact with the plants.

Typically one lump under one armpit. That said,\n I assumed it was an ingrown hair or some type of irritation from deodorant. I ignored these lumps as they were few and far between. I also researched the lumps and found that when painful,\n they typically are not serious. I noticed online that people suggested draining the lump themselves,\n poking with a needle,\n popping like a zit,\n etc. I do not think this is smart whatsoever. You will only cause additional irritation. One thing I have not seen as a suggestion,\n to ease the pain and draw the lump out of the skin,\n is epsom salt. I use a warm compress of water and epsom salt when I get these lumps. I do this a few times a day and leave the warm rag under my arm for roughly ten minutes each time. This method works!! The fluid in the lump will draw out and the lump will rupture without poking. If there is a deep lump,\n then you have to let nature take it's course and let it rise to the surface,\n somewhat on it's own,\n but the epsom salt speeds this process along. I thought of this method because growing up my mom used epsom salt to draw out slivers or a stinger. I am shocked that no one has mentioned this online but thought I'd share in hopes it will help someone. With one deep lump I had,\n I used the epsom salt compress on and off for about 3 days and on the 3rd day applied GENTLE pressure with the soft parts of my fingers and viola,\n the lump popped and the pain subsided. Btw,\n it was gross..LOL As for a new experience with lumps that I am currently having,\n I have multiple painful lumps under BOTH sides of my armpits. Obviously,\n this is not an ingrown hair. I have also been; extremely tired,\n have continuous night sweats,\n and shortness of breath. I went to my doctor only to find out that I have a severe infection coursing through my body; which caused the lumps (lymph-node infection). They started me on strong antibiotics and I am awaiting results to find out exactly what type of infection I have. Hope it's not too serious! So,\n the long and the short of it....a lump with no other symptoms may just be caused by some type of irritation. A lump with other symptoms should be inspected by your doctor right away. My doctor said that when these types of infections pop up (lymph-nodes) they can get out of hand very quickly. Just thought I'd share.

Well,\n it depends on who you ask. But the common consensus is that if you regularly come to a climax too early during sex without fulfilling your partner,\n you may be one of many men who are suffering from premature ejaculation (PE). As many as one in three men are believed to be afflicted with this sexual dysfunction. Actual figures may actually be higher as this is an embarrassing ailment that not many guys are willing to openly discuss. What are the symptoms of premature ejaculation? Premature ejaculation can be categorized by lifelong (primary) or acquired (secondary). The former can be characterized by early ejaculation within one minute following intercourse. This is often accompanied by a severe lack of confidence in bed and in worst cases,\n an avoidance of sex altogether. On the other hand,\n secondary PE is often marked by persistent ejaculation before both you and your partner wish that it happens. Guys who are experiencing secondary PE usually have enjoyed fulfilling sexual relationships in the past. Are you at risk? There are some men who are at higher risks of developing premature ejaculation. These include guys who are suffering from some form of erectile dysfunction. Men who have problems with erection often subconsciously hurry through sexual intercourse for fear of losing their erections. One of the biggest contributors to early ejaculation is stress or emotional strain. So men who are often emotionally stressed out are at a higher risk of ejaculating early during sex. This is nature's way of releasing tension that has been pent up. Do you need to seek medical attention? If your lack of sexual endurance is causing great distress to you and your partner,\n it is recommended that you seek medical assistance. The doctor would be able to advice on the appropriate treatment to help you cope with the problem. In some cases,\n the doctor will even suggest that you are not even experiencing early ejaculation,\n especially if it occurs only occasionally. Likewise,\n if you can satisfy your partner even if you do not last more than 2 to 4 minutes during intercourse,\n there is no real cause for concern. Coping with premature ejaculation There are many forms of treatments,\n and what you choose to use will depend on the severity of your condition. These options include natural sexual therapy and conditioning,\n such as the squeeze technique to re-wire your ejaculatory triggers; medications that include the use of anti-depressants or topical anesthetic creams or sprays. The bottom line is,\n premature ejaculation is very common and is a treatable condition. By understanding why you are ejaculating prematurely,\n you can use the appropriate solutions to permanently end your ejaculation problems and achieve the coveted ability to enjoy long-lasting sex!

DIETS DO NOT WORK. They may help you in the short haul but in order to really make progress it takes a complete change in ones lifestyle of eating to have any long term benefits. Over weight? Living a sedentary lifestyle,\n high cholesterol,\n high A1C? Stop and think,\n \"What got me to where I am\". It always ends up being how you eat everyday foods and or sedentary. Here in America we have what is called the S.A.D (Sat American Diet) in which we eat lots of processed or pre-prepared meals laden with salts,\nsugars,\n High fructose corn syrup,\n Processed meats like lunch meats,\n ham,\n bacon,\n hot dogs etc. and processed grains in biscuits,\n breads,\n pasta,\n etc. Every one of these foods causes our bodies to \"revolt\" against their acidic causing processes within our body resulting in obesity,\n mineral and vit shortages (like calcium and magnessium) and many other health problems If,\n and only if you change your lifestyle of eating for the rest of your life will you see any long term benefits to what people call Diets! You stop dieting,\n you go back to being heavy,\n sick,\n and even diabetic. You must change your lifestyle of eating. You cannot do the same things that got you to where you are with your health and expect lasting results. Proof of this comes from people having bariatric and lap band surgery. They lose weight and their diabetes goes into remission,\n but,\n if they return to their old eating ways the weight and diabetes will come back. I was a diebetic for 15 yrd taking the max dose of Lantus plus metformin and B/P pills,\n Cholesterol plls and an A1C of 7.2. I changed my lifestyle of eating to what is called the alkaline lifestyle and am now off all pills or meds for any health problems.
