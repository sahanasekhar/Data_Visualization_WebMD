Does he or she have trouble focusing and completing a task? You may be wondering if your child has Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). For starters,\n a diagnosis of ADHD is based on a combination of inattentive,\n impulsive and hyperactive behaviors that are inappropriate for the age of the child. And most of the time,\n ADHD is not diagnosed until a child enters school. Why? Because virtually all preschoolers have trouble paying attention and sitting still! So,\n dont book a consultation with your childs doctor because your preschooler doesnt want to sit around during storytime. Heres what you need to know about ADHD: Q. Is ADHD hereditary? Yes. Interestingly,\n ADD [attention deficit disorder] and ADHD tends to run in families. Often,\n a parent realizes he or she has the disorder when his or her child is going through the evaluation process. Q. What signs should I be looking for in my child? * Hyperactivity: A child will constantly fidget with his hands or body. He may seem like he is always on the go. He may have trouble sitting in his seat or playing quietly. And,\n he may talk incessantly. * Impulsivity: A child will have trouble taking turns in play. He may blurt out answers in the classroom or interrupt other childrens activities. As a result,\n he may be rejected by his peers. * Inattention: A child may be very disorganized and have trouble completing tasks,\n even ones that are fun. He may be forgetful and gloss over details. Q. What is the difference between ADD and ADHD? The H stands for hyperactivity. Kids with ADD are not fidgety or loud and so they have fewer behavior problems in the classroom. Thus,\n they often are diagnosed later  often a child will be eight or nine before ADD kids are identified. Q. If I am worried about ADD/ADHD,\n who should I turn to for help? Start with your childs teacher. He or she can fill out a checklist that demonstrates your childs successes and challenges in a classroom setting. You will also be asked to do an assessment of your child in your home setting,\n as well. The next step is to discuss the finding with your childs doctor. The doctor may conduct the complete evaluation and treatment process himself,\n or he may refer your child for additional evaluations and potentially,\n treatment with a specialist.

Many studies have shown a connection between obesity and urinary incontinence in women,\n especially stress urinary incontinence (you leak when you are coughing,\n laughing or putting physical \"stress\" on your bladder). Excess body weight tends to increase bladder pressure (increased weight on the bladder and pelvis) and may also impair blood flow and nerve impulses to the bladder. Studies show a positive correlation between high BMI ... and urinary incontinence,\n and the correlation is more pronounced in women than in men. Research has also shown that very obese women who undergo extreme weight loss due to gastric surgery see a decrease in their stress urinary incontinence symptoms.

There are two major reasons for very prolonged/heavy periods: hormonal and what I call \"structural\". \"Structural\" means when excessive bleeding is due to actual problems within the cavity or walls of the uterus.

Hormonal causes are usually linked to missed or erratic ovulations. As you may know,\n in a normal cycle,\n estrogen is produced all month. Estrogen is responsible for building up the lining of your uterus so you have something to shed each month. In a normal cycle,\n progesterone production increases following ovulation. Progesterone \"stabilizes\" the uterine lining in preparation for a possible implantation of a new pregnancy. If you are not pregnant that month the levels of estrogen and progesterone fall,\n triggering the release of the uterine liningyour period. So,\n if you do not ovulate,\n the estrogen build up of the lining continues,\n but without the usual ovulation associated progesterone. Thus,\n the hormone levels don't decline,\n and the lining stays up inside the uterusyour missed/late period. Alternatively the lining can begin to shed under its own weight producing prolonged bleeding. ... Causes for not ovulating are multifold: thyroid problems,\n pituitary problems,\n ovarian cysts,\n physical stressors (e.g. sudden increases in exercise,\n crash dieting),\n emotional stressors (problems with partners,\n work/school,\n finances),\n increased body weight,\n anorexia,\n rotating shifts at work,\n etc. ...

Dental implants look and feel like your own teeth. And because they are designed to fuse with bone,\n they become permanent. Improved speech. With poor-fitting dentures,\n the teeth can slip within the mouth causing you to mumble or slur your words. Dental implants allow you to speak without the worry that your teeth might slip. Improved comfort. Because they become part of you,\n implants eliminate the discomfort of removable dentures. Easier eating. Sliding dentures can make chewing difficult. Dental implants function like your own teeth,\n allowing you to eat your favorite foods with confidence and without pain. Improved self-esteem. Dental implants can give you back your smile and help you feel better about yourself. Improved oral health. Dental implants don't require reducing other teeth,\n as a tooth-supported bridge does. Because nearby teeth are not altered to support the implant,\n more of your own teeth are left intact,\n improving your long-term oral health. Individual implants also allow easier access between teeth,\n improving oral hygiene. Durability. Implants are very durable and will last many years. With good care,\n many implants last a lifetime.

We've learned about neurobiological mechanisms that lead to fibro and ultimately \"rewire\" our central nervous system. ... Here's my list of causes and the % I see. 1. Genetics. I'm going to say close to 100% have this \"default\" cause. A number of studies support increased FM in families (ie autosomal dominant,\n offspring of someone with FM is 8x more likely to have fibro,\n etc.) or inherited differences in neurotransmitters (serotonin,\n COMT enzyme,\n dopamine,\n mu-opioid receptor,\n etc,\n) making one more prone to chronic pain/FM. I think most everyone with fibro is genetically susceptible to getting it although a different trigger actually may start the fibro \"cascade.\" But up to 40% of my patients may not have another \"trigger\",\n but simply develop FM over time due to prewired genetics. 2. Trauma. This may be physical or emotional trauma. About 40% of my patients also. This includes whiplash injuries,\n work injuries,\n post-surgery fibro,\n catastrophic stresses (war,\n loss of loved one,\n loss of job,\n etc,\n) and in this category,\n a special type of trauma: pregnancy-induced FM. Various researchers in FM including Dr. Romano,\n Greenfield,\n Waylonis,\n Buskila,\n Wolfe,\n Clauw have published on FM related to trauma. I see this a lot,\n unfortunately. Sometimes right before my very eyes and despite my best efforts,\n a person with a whiplash injury,\n for example,\n goes on to develop widespread pain and generalized FM. 3. Inflammatory conditions/connective tissue disease (lupus,\n rheumatoid arthritis,\n autoimmune disease,\n polymyalgia rheumatica,\n etc.) Many people get FM associated with another disease such as these mentioned. These conditions trigger the FM and in this case,\n the FM may be referred to as reactive FM or secondary FM. This is about 10% of my patients. 4. Infection. A number of patients report they were fine,\n they got an infection,\n and it was like hitting a brick wall: they developed fatigue and pain ever since. Examples include mono,\n mycoplasma,\n chlamydia,\n cytomegalovirus,\n Lymes,\n and more. I estimate 4% of my patients have this category. 5. Hormone alterations (e.g. hypothroidism,\n menopause). This is a true \"chicken or egg\" but I'm going to say 2% of my patients have this cause. 6. Spinal conditions (e.g. Arnold Chiari malformation,\n spinal stenosis,\n arthritis,\n etc.). We know there is a relationship between cervical spine conditions esp[ecially] leading to FM,\n and I estimate 2% of my patients have this. 7. Toxic exposures. Chemicals,\n toxins,\n vaccines,\n etc. can trigger an immune reaction and lead to chemical sensitivity syndrome or even FM. 1% of my patients. 8. Other conditions. This category includes peripheral pain syndromes that lead to generalized FM,\n or neuro conditons like MS or post-polio syndrome that may trigger FM. Many peripheral pain syndromes (like RSD or complex regional pain syndrome) are caused by trauma so if the person gets FM eventually,\n the cause is really the trauma. Let's call this 1%.

Our soft tissues may be more susceptible to the degenerative \"wear and tear\" changes we all get with aging and overuse.

Most (but not all) migraine attacks are associated with headaches. Migraine headaches usually are described as an intense,\n throbbing or pounding pain that involves one temple. (Sometimes the pain is located in the forehead,\n around the eye,\n or in the back of the head). The pain usually is unilateral (on one side of the head),\n although about a third of the time the pain is bilateral. The unilateral headaches typically change sides from one attack to the next. (In fact,\n unilateral headaches that always occur on the same side should alert the doctor to consider a secondary headache,\n for example,\n one caused by a brain tumor). A migraine headache usually is aggravated by daily activities such as walking upstairs. Nausea,\n vomiting,\n diarrhea,\n paleness,\n cold hands,\n cold feet,\n and sensitivity to light and sound commonly accompany migraine headaches. As a result of this sensitivity to light and sound,\n migraine sufferers usually prefer to lie in a quiet,\n dark room during an attack. A typical attack lasts between four and 72 hours. An estimated 40% to 60% of migraine attacks are preceded by premonitory (warning) symptoms lasting hours to days. The symptoms may include sleepiness,\n irritability,\n fatigue,\n depression or euphoria,\n yawning,\n and cravings for sweet or salty foods. Patients and their family members usually know that when they observe these warning symptoms that a migraine attack is beginning. An estimated 20% of migraine headaches are associated with an aura. Usually,\n the aura precedes the headache,\n although occasionally it may occur simultaneously with the headache. The most common auras are 1) flashing,\n brightly colored lights in a zigzag pattern (fortification spectra),\n usually starting in the middle of the visual field and progressing outward and 2) a hole (scotoma) in the visual field,\n also known as a blind spot. Some elderly migraine sufferers may experience only the visual aura without the headache. A less common aura consists of pins-and-needles sensations in the hand and the arm on one side or pins-and-needles sensations around the mouth and the nose on the same side. Other auras include auditory (hearing) hallucinations and abnormal tastes and smells. Complicated migraines are migraines that are accompanied by neurological dysfunction. The part of the body that is affected by the dysfunction is determined by the part of the brain that is responsible for the headache. Vertebrobasilar migraines are characterized by dysfunction of the brain stem (the lower part of the brain that is responsible for automatic activities like consciousness and balance). The symptoms of vertebrobasilar migraines include fainting as an aura,\n vertigo (dizziness in which the environment seems to be spinning),\n and double vision. Hemiplegic migraines are characterized by paralysis or weakness of one side of the body or mimicking a stroke. The paralysis or weakness is usually temporary,\n but sometimes it can last for days. Retinal,\n or ocular,\n migraines are rare attacks characterized by repeated instances of scotomata (blind spots) or blindness on one side,\n lasting less than an hour,\n that can be associated with headache. Irreversible vision loss can be a complication of this rare form of migraine. For approximately 24 hours after a migraine attack,\n the migraine sufferer may feel drained of energy and may experience a low-grade headache along with sensitivity to light and sound. Unfortunately,\n some sufferers may have recurrences of the headache during this period.

If the result of a screening test is normal,\n the disease is presumed not to be present. If a screening test is abnormal,\n the disease is then suspected to be present,\n and further tests usually are needed to confirm the suspicion (that is,\n to make the diagnosis definitively). Prostate cancer usually is suspected initially because of an abnormality of one or both of the two screening tests that are used to detect prostate cancer. These screening tests are a digital rectal examination and a blood test called the prostate specific antigen (PSA). In the digital rectal examination,\n the doctor feels (palpates) the prostate gland with his gloved index finger in the rectum to detect abnormalities of the gland. Thus,\n a lump,\n irregularity,\n or hardness felt on the surface of the gland is a finding that is suspicious for prostate cancer. Accordingly,\n doctors usually recommend doing a digital rectal examination in men age 40 and over. The PSA test is a simple,\n reproducible,\n and relatively accurate blood test. It is used to detect a protein (the prostate specific antigen) that is released from the prostate gland into the blood. The PSA level is usually higher than 4ng/mL in people with prostate cancer than in people without the cancer. Situations of large prostate size,\n infection and inflammation are other reasons why the PSA may be elevated. The PSA,\n therefore,\n is valuable as a screening test for prostate cancer. Accordingly,\n doctors usually recommend doing a PSA in men age 40 and over. Subsequent screening is recommended based on individual preference and assessment of risk for developing prostate cancer. For example,\n patients with a high risk of developing prostate cancer due to a family history or a high initial PSA should have more frequent evaluation (usually annually). Although,\n still considered controversial,\n most urologists recommend regular screening for prostate cancer in men who are likely to live for more than 10 years. The American Urological Association (AUA) issued their latest guidelines for prostate cancer in 2009. According to these,\n men at the age of 40 should be offered a baseline PSA test and a prostate exam (digital rectal exam or DRE) to ascertain the risk of prostate cancer. Subsequent screening and tests may be performed according to the findings on this initial evaluation and an individual's risk of getting the disease on the basis of other factors such as race,\n ethnicity,\n and family history of prostate cancer. As mentioned,\n most urologists currently would advise some form of screening in men with a life expectancy greater than 10 years. Most frequently,\n it would be performed on an annual basis. Although,\n there is no definite cutoff age to stop prostate cancer screening,\n most physicians would rarely screen men more than 75 years of age for this disease. Results of the PSA test under 4 nanograms per milliliter of blood are generally considered normal. There is a recent trend,\n however,\n to perform prostate biopsy in all patients with a PSA more than 2.5 ng/ml in order to detect prostate cancer at an earlier (and hopefully,\n completely curable) stage. The American Urological Association guidelines (2009) do not define a definite cutoff point but advise that all the other risk factors for prostate cancer should be taken into account while making a decision on whether to proceed for a biopsy. One of the important factors that needs to be considered is the rate at which the PSA value has increased over time on repeated measurements (PSA velocity). Results between 4 and 10 are considered borderline. These borderline values are interpreted in the context of the patient's age,\n symptoms,\n signs,\n family history,\n and changes in the PSA levels over time. Results higher than 10 are considered abnormal,\n suggesting the possibility of prostate cancer. It has been shown that the higher the PSA value,\n the more likely the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Moreover,\n the level of PSA tends to increase when the cancer has progressed from organ-confined prostate cancer to local spread to distant (metastatic) spread. Very high values,\n such as 30 or 40 and over,\n are usually caused by prostate cancer.

Frequently recommended treatments include pain and fever medications (such as acetaminophen [Tylenol]),\n decongestants and mucolytics. Bacterial infection of the sinuses is suspected when facial pain,\n nasal discharge resembling pus,\n and symptoms persist for longer than a week and are not responding to OTC nasal medications. Acute sinus infection from bacteria is usually treated with antibiotic therapy aimed at treating the most common bacteria known to cause sinus infection,\n since it is unusual to be able to get a reliable culture without aspirating the sinuses. The five most common bacteria causing sinus infections are Streptococcus pneumoniae,\n Haemophilus influenzae,\n Moraxella catarrhalis,\n Staphylococcus aureus,\n and Streptococcus pyogenes. The antibiotics that are effective treatment for sinus infection must be able to kill these bacterial types. Although amoxicillin (Amoxil) is an acceptable first antibiotic for an uncomplicated acute sinus infection,\n many physicians choose amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin) as the first-line drug for treatment of a suspected bacterial sinus infection because it is usually effective against most of the species and strains of bacteria that cause the disease. In the penicillin allergic individual,\n cefaclor (Ceclor),\n loracarbef (Lorabid),\n clarithromycin (Biaxin),\n azithromycin (Zithromax),\n sulfamethoxazole (Gantanol),\n trimethoprim (Bactrim,\n Septra) and other antibiotics may be used as first choices. If a patient is not improving after five days of treatment with amoxicillin,\n the patient may be switched to one of the above drugs or amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin. Generally,\n an effective antibiotic needs to be continued for a minimum of 10-14 days. It is however not unusual to need to treat sinus infection for 14-21 days. Taking decongestants (pseudoephedrine) and mucolytics (guaifenesin) orally may be helpful in assisting drainage of sinus infection. The treatment of chronic forms of sinus infection requires longer courses of medications,\n such as Augmentin,\n and may require a sinus drainage procedure. This drainage typically requires a surgical operation to open the blocked sinus under general anesthesia. In general,\n antihistamines should be avoided unless it is felt that the sinusitis sinus infection is due to allergy,\n such as from pollens,\n dander,\n or other environmental causes. It is likely that the use of a topical nasal steroid spray will help reduce swelling in the allergic individual without the drying that is caused by using antihistamines although both are occasionally used.

For these individuals,\n early treatment of allergic sinusitis may prevent development of secondary bacterial sinusitis.

As a matter of fact,\n these cancers frequently are first detected by an abnormality on a blood test (the PSA) or as a hard nodule (lump) in the prostate gland. Occasionally,\n the doctor may first feel a hard nodule during a routine digital (done with the finger) rectal examination. The prostate gland is located immediately in front of the rectum. Rarely,\n in more advanced cases,\n the cancer may enlarge and press on the urethra. As a result,\n the flow of urine diminishes and urination becomes more difficult. Patients may also experience burning with urination or blood in the urine. As the tumor continues to grow,\n it can completely block the flow of urine,\n resulting in a painfully obstructed and enlarged urinary bladder. These symptoms by themselves,\n however,\n do not confirm the presence of prostate cancer. Most of these symptoms can occur in men with non-cancerous (benign) enlargement of the prostate (the most common form of prostate enlargement). However,\n the occurrence of these symptoms should prompt an evaluation by the doctor to rule out cancer and provide appropriate treatment. Furthermore,\n in the later stages,\n prostate cancer can spread locally into the surrounding tissue or the nearby lymph nodes,\n called the pelvic nodes. The cancer then can spread even farther (metastasize) to other areas of the body. Symptoms of metastatic disease include fatigue,\n malaise,\n and weight loss. During a rectal examination,\n the doctor can sometimes detect local spread into the surrounding tissues. That is,\n the physician can feel a hard,\n fixed (not moveable) tumor extending from and beyond the gland. Prostate cancer usually metastasizes first to the lower spine or the pelvic bones (the bones connecting the lower spine to the hips),\n thereby causing back or pelvic pain. The cancer can then spread to the liver and lungs.

Deciding to have no treatment is always a reasonable option if the growths are not bothersome. If the tags are bothersome,\n multiple home and medical options are available: Tie off tag at narrow base with a piece of dental floss or string. Freeze tag with liquid nitrogen. Burn tag using electric cautery or Hyfrecator. Remove tag with scissors,\n with or without anesthetic. There are several effective medical ways to remove a skin tag,\n including removing with scissors,\n freezing (using liquid nitrogen),\n and burning (using medical electric cautery at the physician's office). Usually small tags may be removed easily without anesthesia while larger growths may require some local anesthesia (injected lidocaine) prior to removal. Application of a topical anesthesia cream (Betacaine cream or LMX 5% cream) prior to the procedure may be desirable in areas where there are a large number of tags. Dermatologists (skin specialist doctors),\n family physicians,\n and internal medicine physicians are the doctors who treat tags most often. Occasionally,\n an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) is needed to remove tags very close to the eyelid margin. There are also home remedies and self-treatments,\n including tying off the small tag stalk with a piece of thread or dental floss and allowing the tag to fall off over several days. The advantage of scissor removal is that the growth is immediately removed and there are instant results. The potential disadvantage of any kind of scissor or minor surgical procedure to remove tags is minor bleeding. Possible risks with freezing or burning include temporary skin discoloration,\n need for repeat treatment(s),\n and failure for the tag to fall off. There is no evidence that removing tags causes more tags to grow. Rather,\n there are some people who may be more prone to developing skin tags and may have new growths periodically. Some patients even require periodic removal of tags at annual or quarterly intervals.

Congestive heart failure can be caused by: The heart has two atria (right atrium and left atrium) that make up the upper chambers of the heart,\n and two ventricles (left ventricle and right ventricle) that make up the lower chambers of the heart. The ventricles are muscular chambers that pump blood when the muscles contract. The contraction of the ventricle muscles is called systole. Many diseases can impair the pumping action of the ventricles. For example,\n the muscles of the ventricles can be weakened by heart attacks or infections (myocarditis). The diminished pumping ability of the ventricles due to muscle weakening is called systolic dysfunction. After each ventricular contraction (systole) the ventricle muscles need to relax to allow blood from the atria to fill the ventricles. This relaxation of the ventricles is called diastole. Diseases such as hemochromatosis (iron overload) or amyloidosis can cause stiffening of the heart muscle and impair the ventricles' capacity to relax and fill; this is referred to as diastolic dysfunction. The most common cause of this is longstanding high blood pressure resulting in a thickened (hypertrophied) heart. Additionally,\n in some patients,\n although the pumping action and filling capacity of the heart may be normal,\n abnormally high oxygen demand by the body's tissues (for example,\n with hyperthyroidism or anemia) may make it difficult for the heart to supply an adequate blood flow (called high output heart failure). In some individuals one or more of these factors can be present to cause congestive heart failure. The remainder of this article will focus primarily on congestive heart failure that is due to heart muscle weakness,\n systolic dysfunction. Congestive heart failure can affect many organs of the body. For example: The weakened heart muscles may not be able to supply enough blood to the kidneys,\n which then begin to lose their normal ability to excrete salt (sodium) and water. This diminished kidney function can cause the body to retain more fluid. The lungs may become congested with fluid (pulmonary edema) and the person's ability to exercise is decreased. Fluid may likewise accumulate in the liver,\n thereby impairing its ability to rid the body of toxins and produce essential proteins. The intestines may become less efficient in absorbing nutrients and medicines. Fluid also may accumulate in the extremities,\n resulting in edema (swelling) of the ankles and feet. Eventually,\n untreated,\n worsening congestive heart failure will affect virtually every organ in the body.

High blood pressure (hypertension),\n heart failure,\n heart rhythm disturbances,\n atherosclerotic heart disease,\n pulmonary hypertension,\n insulin resistance,\n and even death are some of the known complications of untreated obstructive sleep apnea. High blood pressure Sleep apnea causes high blood pressure and heart problems. Cessation of breathing frequently during the night (every 1-4 minutes) can cause increased stress on the heart. As the oxygen saturation in the blood decreases and the apnea continues,\n the sympathetic nervous system (responsible for the \"fight or flight\" response of the body) is activated. This fight or flight response sends nerve signals to the blood vessels to constrict (tighten up) and to the heart to work harder. When the vessels constrict,\n more blood is sent to the brain and muscles. However,\n this increases the blood pressure,\n which requires the heart to work harder to pump blood through the smaller caliber vessels. That,\n combined with the signal for the heart to work harder and the lower available oxygen in the blood from apnea,\n causes increased stress on the heart throughout the night. During sleep is normally the time when the heart has less work to do and can \"rest.\" Among patients with obstructive sleep apnea that do not have high blood pressure,\n 45% will develop high blood pressure within four years. If you examine patients who have hard-to-control blood pressure,\n that is,\n taking more than one medicine for control,\n 80% have obstructive sleep apnea. When the obstructive sleep apnea is treated blood pressure decreases. Heart complications The risk for congestive heart failure increases by 2.3 times and the risk of stroke by 1.5 times with obstructive sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea can complicate the treatment of atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is a condition in which the upper part of the heart (atrium) is beating out of coordination with the lower part (ventricle). The treatment is to cardiovert the heart (resetting the atrium and allowing it to synchronize with the ventricle). After cardioversion,\n 50% of patients have a recurrence of atrial fibrillation,\n but patients with obstructive sleep apnea have an 80% recurrence. Finally,\n obstructive sleep apnea can increase the risk of sudden death. Sudden death can kill not only the patient but also their loved ones,\n for example,\n if they are driving a car when the death occurs.

The pain is in the chest and is usually sharp and aggravated by breathing. However,\n the pain can be confused with the pain of: inflammation around the heart (pericarditis) heart attack (myocardial infarction) To make the diagnosis of pleurisy,\n the doctor examines the chest in the area of pain and can often hear (with a stethoscope) the friction that is generated by the rubbing of the two inflamed layers of pleura with each breath. The noise generated by this sound is termed a pleural friction rub. (In contrast,\n the friction of the rubbing that is heard with pericarditis occurs synchronous with the heartbeat and does not vary with respiration.) With large amounts of pleural fluid accumulation,\n there can be decreased breath sounds (less audible respiratory sounds heard through a stethoscope) and the chest is dull sounding when the doctor drums on it (termed dullness upon percussion). A chest X-ray taken in the upright position and while lying on the side is an accurate tool in diagnosing small amounts of fluid in the pleural space. It is possible to estimate the amount of fluid collection by findings on the X-ray. Occasionally,\n as much as 4-5 liters of fluid can accumulate inside the pleural space. Ultrasound is also a very sensitive method of detecting the presence of pleural fluid. A CT scan can be very helpful in detecting trapped pockets of pleural fluid as well as in determining the nature of the tissues surrounding the area. Removal of pleural fluid with a needle and syringe (aspiration) is essential in diagnosing the cause of pleurisy. The fluid's color,\n consistency,\n and clarity are analyzed in the laboratory. The fluid analysis is defined as either an \"exudate\" (high in protein,\n low in sugar,\n high in LDH enzyme,\n and high white cell count; characteristic of an inflammatory process) or a \"transudate\" (containing normal levels of these body chemicals). Causes of exudative fluid include infections (such as pneumonia),\n cancer,\n tuberculosis,\n and collagen diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus). Causes of transudative fluid are congestive heart failure and liver and kidney diseases. Pulmonary emboli can cause either transudates or exudates in the pleural space. The fluid can also be tested for the presence of infectious organisms and cancer cells.

Through this pipelike instrument,\n the scar tissue,\n pus,\n and debris can be removed. Sometimes,\n an open surgical procedure (thoracotomy) is required for more complicated cases. In cases of pleural effusion that result from cancer,\n the fluid often reaccumulates. In this setting,\n a procedure called pleurodesis is used. This procedure entails instilling an irritant,\n such as bleomycin,\n tetracycline,\n or talc powder,\n inside the space between the pleural layers in order to create inflammation. This inflammation,\n in turn,\n will adhere or tack the two layers of pleura together as scarring develops. This procedure thereby obliterates the space between the pleura and prevents the reaccumulation of fluid.

Aggressive treatments of elevations in blood pressure have been extremely important in preventing kidney failure. Blood-pressure medications,\n particularly the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor class of drugs,\n such as captopril (Capoten),\n are frequently used. Recent data indicate that colchicine can be helpful in decreasing the inflammation and tenderness that periodically accompanies the calcinosis nodules in the skin. Skin itching can be relieved with lotions (emollients) such as Eucerin and Lubriderm. Mild Raynaud's phenomenon may require only hand warming and protection. Low-dose aspirin is often added to prevent tiny blood clots in the fingers,\n especially in patients with a history of fingertip ulcerations. Moderate Raynaud's phenomenon can be helped by medications that open up the arteries,\n such as nifedipine (Procardia,\n Adalat) and nicardipine (Cardene),\n or with topical nitroglycerin applied to the most affected digit (most effective on the sides of the digit where the arteries are). Gently applied finger splinting can protect tender tissues. (It is important to not constrict the tiny arteries on the sides of the fingers when protecting them with splints,\n braces,\n or band-aid materials.) A class of medications that is typically used for depression,\n called serotonin reuptake inhibitors,\n such as fluoxetine (Prozac),\n can sometimes improve the circulation of the affected digit. Severe Raynaud's phenomenon can require surgical procedures,\n such as those to interrupt the nerves of the finger that stimulate constriction of the blood vessels (digital sympathectomy). Ulcerations of the fingers can require topical or oral antibiotics. Esophagus irritation and heartburn can be relieved with omeprazole (Prilosec),\n esomeprazole (Nexium),\n or lansoprazole (Prevacid). Antacids can also be helpful. Elevating the head of the bed can reduce the back-flow of acid into the esophagus that causes inflammation and heartburn. Avoiding caffeine and cigarette smoking also helps. Constipation,\n cramping,\n and diarrhea is sometimes caused by bacteria that can be treated with tetracycline or erythromycin. Studies have shown that erythromycin could also be used. Increased fluid intake and fiber intake are good general measures. Irritated,\n itchy dry skin can be helped by emollients such as Lubriderm,\n Eucerin,\n Bag Balm histamine 2 blockers,\n or trazodone (Desyrel). Telangiectasias,\n such as those on the face,\n can be treated with local laser therapy. Sun exposure should be minimized as it can worsen telangiectasias. Approximately 10% of patients with the CREST variant develop elevated pressures in the blood vessels to the lungs (pulmonary hypertension). Abnormally elevated blood pressure of the arteries supplying the lungs is often treated with calcium antagonist medications,\n such as nifedipine (Procardia),\n and blood-thinning drugs (anticoagulation). More severe pulmonary hypertension can be helped by continuous intravenous infusion or inhalation of prostacyclin (Iloprost). Taken by mouth,\n bosentan (Tracleer),\n is now also available to treat pulmonary hypertension. In addition,\n sildenafil (Viagra) and tadalafil (Cialis) have been FDA approved to treat pulmonary hypertension. Additionally,\n medications are used to suppress the overly active immune system that seems to be spontaneously causing the disease in organs. Medications used for this purpose include penicillamine,\n azathioprine (Imuran,\n Azasan),\n and methotrexate (Rheumatrex,\n Trexall). Recent research has found that low-dose penicillamine (Depen,\n Cuprimine) (125 mg every other day) is as effective as previously used high doses of penicillamine,\n with less toxicity. Serious inflammation of the lungs (alveolitis) can require immune suppression with cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) along with prednisone (Deltasone,\n Liquid Pred). The optimal treatment of scleroderma lung disease is an area of active research. Stem-cell transplantation is being explored as a possible option. No medication has been found to be universally effective for all patients with scleroderma. In an individual patient,\n the illness may be mild and not require treatments. In some,\n the disease is ravaging and relentless.

Because scleroderma can affect the skin,\n esophagus,\n blood vessels,\n kidneys,\n lungs,\n blood pressure and bowels,\n the symptoms it causes can involve many areas of the body. Scleroderma affects the skin to cause local or widespread signs of inflammation (redness,\n swelling,\n tenderness,\n itching,\n and pain) that can lead to skin tightness or hardening. These skin changes can be widespread,\n but it's most common for them to affect the fingers,\n feet,\n face,\n and neck. This can lead to decreased range of motion of the fingers,\n toes,\n and jaw. Tiny areas of calcification (calcinosis),\n while not common,\n can sometimes be noticed as hard nodules at the tips of the elbows or in the fingers. Scleroderma affecting the esophagus leads to heartburn. This is directly a result of stomach acid flowing back up into the esophagus. Sometimes this can lead to scarring of the esophagus,\n resulting in narrowing with difficulty swallowing food and/or localized pain in the central chest. Blood vessels that can be affected include the tiny arterioles of the finger tips,\n toes,\n and elsewhere. These vessels can have a tendency to spasm when the areas are exposed to cold,\n leading to blueness,\n whiteness,\n and redness of involved fingers,\n toes,\n and sometimes nose or ears. These color changes are referred to as Raynaud's phenomenon. Raynaud's phenomenon can cause inadequate supply of oxygen to the involve tips of fingers or toes,\n causing tiny ulcers or blackened (dead) skin. Sometimes Raynaud's phenomenon is also associated with tingling. Other blood vessels that can be involved in scleroderma are the tiny capillaries of the face,\n lips,\n mouth,\n or fingers. These capillaries widen (dilate),\n forming tiny,\n red blanching spots,\n called telangiectasias. Elevated blood pressure is potentially serious and can lead to kidney damage. Symptoms include headache,\n fatigue,\n and in severe cases,\n stroke. Blood pressure monitoring and control is essential. Inflammation of the lungs in scleroderma can cause scarring,\n resulting in shortness of breath,\n especially with physical exertion. Elevated pressure in the arteries to the lungs (pulmonary hypertension) can also cause shortness of breath and difficulty getting an adequate breath with activity.

But how useful is it? To study the effectiveness of bed rest in patients with sciatica of sufficient severity to justify treatment with bed rest for two weeks,\n a research team in the Netherlands led by Dr. Patrick Vroomen randomly assigned 183 such patients to bed rest or,\n alternatively,\n to watchful waiting for this period. To gauge the outcome,\n both primary and secondary measures were examined. The primary outcome measures were the global assessments of improvement after two and 12 weeks by the doctor and the patient. The secondary outcome measures were changes in functional status and in pain scores,\n absenteeism from work,\n and the need for surgical intervention. Neither the doctors who assessed the outcomes nor those involved in data entry and analysis were aware of the patients' treatment assignments. The results,\n reported in the New England Journal of Medicine,\n showed that after two weeks,\n 64 of the 92 (70%) patients in the bed-rest group reported improvement,\n as compared with 59 of the 91 (65%) of the patients in the control (watchful-waiting) group. After 12 weeks,\n 87% of the patients in both groups reported improvement. The results of assessments of the intensity of pain,\n the aggravation of symptoms,\n and functional status revealed no significant differences between the two groups. The extent of absenteeism from work and rates of surgical intervention were similar in the two groups. The researchers concluded that \"among patients with symptoms and signs of a lumbosacral radicular syndrome,\n bed rest is not a more effective therapy than watchful waiting.\" Sometimes,\n conventional wisdom is not as wise as research! Other treatment options for sciatica include addressing the underlying cause,\n medications to relieve pain and inflammation and relax muscles,\n and physical therapy. A variety of low back conditioning and stretching exercises are employed to help people recover from sciatica.

The principles of a gluten-free diet include: In most patients,\n a gluten-free diet will result in improvements in symptoms within weeks. Many patients report symptom improvements within 48 hours. In children with celiac disease,\n the response to a gluten-free diet can be dramatic. Not only will diarrhea and abdominal discomfort subside,\n but behavior also improves,\n and growth resumes (with rapid catch-up in height).

This article will cover the common ones. Studies show that losing up to 100-150 hairs per day is normal. Human hair naturally grows in three phases: anagen,\n catagen,\n and telogen. Anagen is the active or growing phase. Catagen is a fairly short phase of the natural hair cycle during which hairs begin to break down. Telogen is the resting phase. The hairs that are shed daily are often in the resting or late phase in the hair cycle. Normally,\n about 10% of the scalp hairs are in the resting or telogen phase at any time. These hairs are not growing and are getting prepared for cyclic shedding. In general,\n most hair loss is not associated with systemic or internal disease,\n nor is poor diet a frequent factor. Frequently,\n hair may simply thin as a result of predetermined genetic factors,\n family history,\n and the overall aging process. Many men and women may notice a mild and often normal physiologic thinning of hair starting in their thirties and forties. Other times,\n normal life variations including temporary severe stress,\n nutritional changes,\n and hormonal changes like those in pregnancy,\n puberty,\n and menopause may cause a reversible hair loss. Notably,\n several health conditions,\n including thyroid disease and iron deficiency anemia,\n can cause hair loss. While thyroid blood tests and other lab tests,\n including a complete blood count (CBC),\n on people who have ordinary hair loss are usually normal,\n it is important to exclude underlying causes in sudden or severe hair loss. If you are concerned about some other underlying health issues,\n you may start by seeing your family physician,\n internist,\n or gynecologist for basic health screening. Dermatologists are doctors who specialize in problems of skin,\n hair,\n and nails and may provide more advanced diagnosis and treatment of hair thinning and loss. Sometimes a scalp biopsy may be taken to help in diagnosis of severe or unexplained hair loss. Although many medications list \"hair loss\" among their potential side effects,\n drugs are also not overall common causes of thinning or lost hair. On the other hand,\n with cancer treatments and immune suppression medications including chemotherapy,\n hair loss is a very common side effect. Complete hair loss often occurs after a course of major chemotherapy for cancer. Usually,\n hair regrows after six to 12 months.

As most people know,\n blood sugar levels rise after eating. In imperfectly controlled diabetes,\n the blood sugar levels often rise higher and longer than in people without diabetes,\n or than in patients with well-controlled diabetes. For example,\n normal people without diabetes might peak at 140 mg/dL about 60 minutes after a meal,\n whereas someone with moderately-well controlled diabetes might peak at 200 mg/dL about 90 minutes after a meal. This is because the beta cells of the pancreas are unable to provide enough insulin to keep the blood sugar levels in the normal range. When people with diabetes find their blood sugar level to be unexpectedly high,\n they might call it a \"spike\". This typically happens after eating a rich meal or a sequence of rich meals. by rich I mean high in starch and/or sugar plus animal fat. The starch/sugar raise the blood sugar,\n and the fat helps keep the sugar levels high by blocking the insulin from working efficiently. Pizza,\n ice cream,\n pasta with butter,\n etc. Note that the timing of the blood sugar testing will have much to do with one's perception of whether the blood sugar has \"spiked\". In my view,\n a \"spike\" is just a snapshot view of a chronic problem. The realy problem is not the \"spike\"--it is a reminder that eating right and exercise are a daily priority,\n and spikes will be common whenever these priorities are not addressed. Use the A1c level to make decisions (with your health care providers) about diabetes management because it reflects the overall glucose control. The frequency or peak of glucose spikes can add supplemental information,\n but I do not believe that lifestyle goals and habits should be based on treating individual spikes.

Theres a general notion that sex is favorable to good health,\n but most doctors dont specifically encourage their patients to have more sex. Naturally,\n we dont want to encourage unprotected or unsafe sex associated with sexually transmitted diseases,\n or sex that leads to unwanted pregnancies. Also,\n we dont want to encourage reckless sex that leads to car accidents or dislocated hips or other unforeseen injuries,\n and the last thing we want is for someone to have a heart attack during sex and blame us for it. However,\n I cant think of a single patient I treat who is likely to have any of those bad outcomes from having more sex. Having a heart attack during sex is very rare,\n and,\n in fact,\n increased sexual frequency is associated with reduced risk of heart disease,\n and is encouraged after recovering from a heart attack. Sex is one form of exercise that most people like! Its good for the heart and circulation,\n and helps maintain good blood flow to the sex organs. Use it or lose it is a fair statement,\n particularly in older people and those with diabetes. Erectile dysfunction occurs in over half of men with diabetes,\n especially after several years of poor blood sugar control,\n and maintaining sexual frequency may potentially help delay or avoid erectile dysfunction. Not surprisingly,\n eating right and exercising can help partially reverse erectile dysfunction in men,\n by improving blood pressure,\n blood flow,\n body fat and hormone levels. Women with diabetes may also be at increased risk for sexual problems,\n and it stands to reason that maintaining an active sex life may help prevent such problems. Healthy sleep habits are very important for diabetes management  and sex and sleep are closely related,\n (enough to be considered bedfellows perhaps). Sex improves sleep,\n and vice versa. Similarly,\n problems with sleep can interfere with sex. Sex releases hormones that help promote sleep (especially in men),\n and sleep promotes hormones that favor good blood sugar control and appetite control. By the same token,\n inadequate sleep quality or quantity promotes hormones that worsen blood sugar control,\n appetite,\n weight gain,\n diabetes and heart disease. So here we have a cycle of gradually decreasing health,\n sleep and sex over time. As one aspect worsens,\n the others may too,\n on and on it goes. The shame of it is that people generally like sex and sleep and feeling good. Can we break the cycle? Is it as simple as turning off the TV an hour earlier and having more sex? Unfortunately,\n its not always so simple. Doctors are in a great position to help patients recognize and reverse this cycle,\n and should embrace the power of healthy sexuality to fight chronic illness,\n but most are not doing so. It is not because doctors are unaware of the health benefits of sex. It is not that doctors are afraid of the remote negative outcomes mentioned above. Doctors dont bring up sex because its so easy not to,\n and because patients dont typically bring it up on their own. This mirrors the reasons doctors and patients often dont bring up obesity and weight loss during the course of a routine health visit. Because visits are often rushed,\n the problem is not acute,\n there are lots of other priorities and starting the discussion seems risky. I know we can do much better.

And that doesnt include the multitude of vitamin waters,\n drink mixes and others. But what about a daily drink to help you sleep? Something made from fruit? And something other than the mythological night cap that entails sleep-disrupting alcohol? Tart cherry juice might be the answer,\n according to a new study by a team from the University of Pennsylvania,\n University of Rochester,\n and VA Center of Canandaigua. The researchers looked at the sleep habits of 15 older adults who drank 8 ounces of tart cherry juice in the morning and evening for two weeks.

Well,\n guess what,\n everyone? Unfortunately,\n many of you are quite wrong,\n and I will explain why. We know that low HDL cholesterol (good cholesterol) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It is included in the most well-known risk factor scoring system for cardiovascular disease called the Framingham scoring. Surprisingly,\n there is little clinical evidence that therapies directed at raising HDL cholesterol reduce risk. I will say that again,\n there is little evidence that raising ones good cholesterol number protects them from having a heart attack,\n a stroke,\n or dying. For this reason,\n the National Cholesterol Education Panel (NCEP) does not specify a number that would be the optimal HDL level of therapy. NCEP also states that raising ones HDL is not a primary or secondary goal of therapy in order to reduce cardiovascular events or death. NCEP ATP-III statements about low HDL cholesterol were published in the journal Circulation in 2002. Here is a selection of facts from the article: * A categorical low HDL-C should be defined as a level of less than 40 mg/dL,\n in both men and women. * Whether raising HDL per se will reduce risk for CHD has not been resolved. (Still true in 2010.) * Some persons with severe deficiency of HDL do not manifest premature coronary heart disease; this suggests that HDL is not uniquely involved in atherogenesis (clogging of the arteries),\n as is LDL cholesterol (the bad cholesterol). * A specific HDL cholesterol goal level to reach with HDL raising therapy is not identified. In summary,\n when we measure HDL cholesterol,\n we are just measuring a number that tells us nothing about how well it functions. There is no way yet to measure how well ones HDL functions,\n and thus,\n if ones level is within normal limits,\n does the person with a higher HDL number have fewer events than a person with lower HDL number? This has never shown to be true in any randomized prospective human studies. This is also defined in scientific terms as no Level 1 evidence. There is only data in retrospective and epidemiological studies that show that the higher the HDL cholesterol number the lower the cardiovascular event rate. I will put another twist in the HDL discussion. There is a level at which the HDL cholesterol in some people may be too high and dysfunctional,\n and actually be harmful to the arteries. There is another group of people whose HDL is called ApoA1 Milano,\n who are all originally from Limone,\n Italy,\n and have very low levels of HDL cholesterol. Approximately 3.5 percent of these people have HDL levels below 10mg/dl and have virtually no evidence of cardiovascular disease whatsoever. This is a kind of super HDL. The bottom line is that in most people,\n low HDL cholesterol is bad and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease,\n but a high level may not be protective. The name of the game is to get the LDL cholesterol (the bad cholesterol) down. If anybody is really curious about this point,\n they can take a look at the Heart and Estrogen Replacement Study. In this study,\n 20 percent of the women who had heart attacks had HDL cholesterol levels in the 60-80 mg/dl range,\n which is well above normal.

The researchers wrote: Statin therapy is associated with a slightly increased risk of development of diabetes,\n but the risk is low both in absolute terms and when compared with the reduction in coronary events. Clinical practice in patients with moderate or high cardiovascular risk or existing cardiovascular disease should not change. Another recent article about atorvastatin showed a similar finding. The problem that people forget is that statins save lives and the level one data proving this fact has been substantiated in multiple large trials. The question I am always asked is: Are statins safe? The short answer is that as a class of drugs they are very safe. These concerns have arisen from information from the news and print media,\n the internet and from direct-to consumer advertising. Unfortunately,\n much of the factual evidence is either overlooked or unknown and because of this often misinformation,\n many patients refuse to initiate statin therapy and others stop long-term treatment out of fear for their safety. To address these concerns about the safety of lipid modulating drugs,\n The National Lipid Association appointed a Safety Assessment Task Force to evaluate statin safety and in a second report,\n the safety of non-statin lipid altering drugs. The charge given to this task force was to conduct a rigorous,\n scholarly,\n up-to-date,\n and unbiased assessment. Four panels were assembled which focused on the muscle,\n liver,\n renal,\n and neurological effects of statins. To assure a rigorous comprehensive assessment of statin safety,\n the Task Force further commissioned reviews of special literature on adverse reactions and drug interactions. Reports of the work included an up-to-the-minute systematic review of published cohort and clinical trial data on statin safety,\n the most recent data from the FDAs AERS,\n an inspection of the data contained in the New Drug Applications,\n and the FDAs Summary Basis of Approvals for marketed statins and associated adverse health events in a 22 million person managed health care database. The results of the Task Force of Statin Safety was published in April 2006 in The American Journal of Cardiology and Non-Statin Safety was published in the same journal in March 2007. In essence,\n what I am saying is that this is the most comprehensive evidence-based unbiased assessment of all these drugs and the guidelines should be followed by all physicians and their patients. Now,\n a little background. Cardiovascular disease (CVD)continues to be an epidemic and is responsible for more than half of all deaths in the United States. Each day more than 2600 Americans die from cardiovascular disease. Approximately 80 million American are affected by CVD and more than 125 million lipid panels are performed annually. Despite the increase in cholesterol testing,\n the number of Americans affected with CVD continues to rise. Abnormal lipids (Dyslipidemia) is well established as one of the strongest independent predictors of CV morbidity and mortality. There have been large outcome trials that have consistently shown that lowering LDL cholesterol reduces morbidity and mortality associated with coronary heart disease. As the data continues to accumulate,\n the notion that lower is better has uniformly been supported. As a result of 5 large clinical trials,\n the National Cholesterol Education Panel (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III has recognized this and new guidelines recommend further reducing the goal the LDL cholesterol to (<70mg/dl) in the most high risk patients. You can read the NCEP guidelines on Lipid Management as well as the newer NCEP guidelines on treatment of metabolic syndrome on my website. Despite this new recommendation,\n the American Heart Associations 2007 statistical update shows that fewer than 20% of patients with CHD have achieved recommended goal levels of LDL cholesterol.

Many people ask which calcium supplement they should take. The best supplement is the one that meets your individual needs. Calcium supplements are available without a prescription in a variety of types such as tablets,\n capsules,\n chewables and liquids. They are also available in different amounts and doses. The body easily absorbs most brand name calcium products. Calcium supplements need to dissolve in the stomach for calcium to absorb. Chewable and liquid supplements dissolve well because they break down before entering the stomach. Calcium,\n whether from diet or supplements,\n is best absorbed when taken in amounts of 500  600 mg or less. Taking your calcium all at once,\n however,\n is better than not taking it at all. Try to get your calcium-rich foods and/or supplements in smaller amounts throughout the day,\n preferably with a meal. Most calcium supplements should be taken with food. Eating food produces stomach acid that helps your body absorb calcium. Calcium citrate supplements,\n on the other hand,\n absorb well when taken with or without food. Side effects,\n such as gas or constipation,\n may occur from calcium supplements. If increasing fluids and fiber in your diet does not solve the problem,\n try another type or brand of calcium. It is important to drink plenty of water (six 8 oz glasses) throughout the day when you are taking calcium supplements. It may require trial and error,\n but fortunately there are many choices. When you take a new calcium supplement,\n start with smaller amounts. For example,\n start with 200-300 mg of calcium a day for a week,\n and drink an extra 6-8 ounces of water with it. Then gradually add more calcium each week. Look carefully at calcium supplement labels for the serving size. Often the amount of calcium shown on the label is the amount you receive in more than 1 tablet or unit. For example,\n the label may show \"Calcium,\n 630 mg,\n\" but if you look at serving size,\n it may show \"2 tablets\". Choose a calcium supplement with vitamin D added to help you reach the daily intake of Vitamin D recommended by your healthcare professional. And finally,\n unless otherwise advised by your health care professional,\n avoid consuming more than 2,\n500 mg of calcium (food plus supplements) per day.

The only way to tell for sure is with a pregnancy test. Spotting and cramping. Breast changes. Fatigue. Nausea (morning sickness). Missed period. The altered balance of hormones in your body can cause multiple symptoms. Many women find frequent urination to be problem starting around the sixth or eighth week after conception. Although this could be caused by a urinary tract infection,\n diabetes,\n or excessive use of diuretics,\n if you're pregnant,\n it's most likely due to increased levels of hormones. The increased level of progesterone can also make you constipated. Progesterone causes food to pass more slowly through your intestines. Drinking plenty of water,\n exercising,\n and eating plenty of high-fiber foods can help offset this problem. Mood swings are common,\n especially during the first trimester. These are also related to changes in hormones. Many women report frequent mild headaches,\n and others experience chronic back pain. Dizziness and fainting may be related to dilating blood vessels,\n lower blood pressure,\n and lower blood sugar. Some women don't discover they're pregnant until they go to the doctor because of a fainting spell and are told that being pregnant is a possible explanation. If you are pregnant,\n you could have all of these symptoms,\n or maybe have only one or two. But if any of these symptoms become bothersome,\n talk with your doctor about them.

With asthma,\n there is inflammation of the air passages that results in a temporary narrowing of the airways that carry oxygen to the lungs. This results in asthma symptoms,\n including coughing,\n wheezing,\n shortness of breath,\n and chest tightness. Some people refer to asthma as \"bronchial asthma.\" Even though there are seemingly miraculous treatments for asthma symptoms,\n asthma is still a serious -- even dangerous -- disease that affects more than 22 million Americans and causes nearly 2 million emergency room visits ever year. With proper asthma treatment,\n you can live well with this condition. Yet inadequate asthma treatment limits the ability to exercise and be active. Poorly controlled asthma can lead to multiple visits to the emergency room and even hospital admission,\n which can affect your performance at home and work. There are three major features of asthma: 1. Airway obstruction. During normal breathing,\n the bands of muscle that surround the airways are relaxed,\n and air moves freely. But in people with asthma,\n allergy-causing substances and environmental triggers make the bands of muscle surrounding the airways tighten,\n and air cannot move freely. Less air causes a person to feel short of breath,\n and the air moving through the tightened airways causes a whistling sound known as wheezing. (Fortunately,\n this airway narrowing is reversible,\n a feature that distinguishes asthma from other lung diseases such as bronchitis or emphysema.) 2. Inflammation. People with asthma have red and swollen bronchial tubes. This inflammation is thought to contribute greatly to the long-term damage that asthma can cause to the lungs. And,\n therefore,\n treating this inflammation is key to managing asthma in the long run. 3. Airway irritability. The airways of people with asthma are extremely sensitive. The airways tend to overreact and narrow due to even the slightest triggers such as pollen,\n animal dander,\n dust,\n or fumes.

Arthritis . Arthritic conditions such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are among the most common causes of hip pain,\n especially in older adults. Arthritis leads to inflammation of the hip joint and the breakdown of the cartilage that normally cushions your hip bones. The pain gradually gets worse as the arthritis progresses. People with arthritis also feel stiffness and have reduced range of motion in the hip. Hip fractures . Fractures of the hip are a particular problem in elderly people. With age,\n the bones can become weak and brittle. Weakened bones are more likely to fracture during a fall. Bursitis . Inflammation of the small,\n fluid-filled sacs (called bursae) that protect muscles and tendons is usually due to repetitive activities that overwork or irritate the hip joint. Tendinitis . Tendons are the thick bands of tissue that attach bones to muscles. Tendinitis is inflammation or irritation of the tendons. It's usually caused by repetitive stress from overuse. Muscle or tendon strain . Repeated activities can put strain on the muscles,\n tendons,\n and ligaments that support the hips. When these structures become inflamed from overuse,\n they can cause pain and prevent the hip from functioning normally. Cancers . Tumors that start in the bone (bone cancer) or that spread to the bone can cause pain in the hips,\n as well as in other bones of the body. Avascular necrosis (also called osteonecrosis) . This condition occurs when blood flow to the hip bone is reduced and the bone tissue dies as a result. Although it can affect other bones,\n avascular necrosis most often occurs in the hip. It can be caused by a hip fracture or dislocation,\n or from the long-term use of high-dose steroids (such as prednisone),\n among other causes.

Suddenly we're much more aware of our cycles and our bodies. We chart our ovulation carefully,\n we time our BD,\n and then we wait  which is the hardest part. We watch for any symptoms that might indicate pregnancy,\n and with every pang or every woozy feeling we think,\n \"Is that a symptom??\" To talk a little about the science of symptoms Most current pregnancy tests are based on the presence of a chemical called human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). Although this chemical is present very early,\n the pregnancy has to connect with your blood system before it can be detected and before you would expect your body to have any symptoms of pregnancy. This connection is made with implantation,\n which occurs 8-10 days after conception. So symptoms (and a positive pregnancy test) might occur a few days before you actually miss your period. Breast changes: There can be a dramatic increase in breast volume early in pregnancy resulting in breast tenderness,\n tingling or noticeable increase in size. This symptom can happen days before you miss your period. Nausea and vomiting: This symptom tends to happen a little later than the breast changes but definitely in the first trimester. It generally happens around the time of your missed period or slightly later (4-6 weeks pregnant) and resolves around 14-16 weeks of your pregnancy. It has been called morning sickness but actually is present throughout the day. Fatigue: It can be dramatic through the first trimester but doesn't usually show up before you've missed your period. Pelvic cramping: Many women complain of cramping in early pregnancy. They usually describe it as feeling \"like my period is about to start.\" It can last for weeks but usually remains more of a background nuisance discomfort than real pain. Although it is a very common normal symptom,\n you should discuss any pelvic pain in early pregnancy with your physician because it can sometimes be a warning sign of a dangerous medical condition. Bleeding: This is a scary one! Many normal pregnancies can have light bleeding with implantation. But when you tell us about bleeding,\n we're worried about the same thing you're worried about,\n could this be a miscarriage. Fortunately we can usually sort things out fairly quickly and put everyone's mind at ease. Although it's a very common,\n \"normal\" symptom,\n it's another symptom that is sometimes a warning sign of a dangerous medical condition so be sure to tell your physician about any unexpected bleeding. Of all of the symptoms listed above,\n breast changes are really the only symptoms that usually occur before you've missed a period. But,\n of course,\n as human beings,\n we have not only the \"science\" of symptoms to consider,\n but the emotional component as well  after all,\n deciding to get pregnant is an emotional decision. So,\n the tricky part for most women is that we can sometimes experience some of these symptoms  or think we are experiencing the symptoms  but we're NOT pregnant at all. Quite an emotional rollercoaster to ride month after month! **To re-emphasize: the symptoms listed above can be symptoms of pregnancy,\n but they can also be symptoms of other medical conditions  please see your doctor if you experience these symptoms.** ", "questionId": "1190687", "memberFollowerNumber": 40, "memberDesc": null, "answerMemberId": "39964", "questionContent": "", "topicName": "women_related", "answerVoteNum": 921, "questionTopicId": "pregnancy-questions", "topicVal": 0.70165378880124496, "memberId": "39964", "questionTitle": "What are some pregnancy symptoms?", "answerId": 24198, "memberHelpfulVotes": 864}]
