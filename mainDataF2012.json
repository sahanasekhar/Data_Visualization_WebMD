There are three different types of blood tests that can be used to measure testosterone levels. So the first step in understanding your level is to find out which test was used and the normal range for men in your age group. Total testosterone is the most common test used. It measures all the testosterone in your blood. A typical range for men over 19 is 240-950 ng/dL,\n but the results vary depending on the lab used. You can also measure free testosterone. Free testosterone is a measure of the testosterone that is not bound to proteins in the blood. A typical range for men is 9-30 ng/dL. Obesity affects the level of sex hormone binding proteins so your doctor may order a free testosterone level if you are obese. Historically,\n it was thought that only free testosterone was able to exert hormonal effects. We now know that testosterone bound to the protein,\n albumin,\n can also exert effects. Bioavailable testosterone measures this level. Bioavailable testosterone varies depending on the age of the man. For a man in his 20s the normal range of bioavailable testosterone would be 83-257 ng/dL,\n but for a man in his 60s,\n it would be 40-168 ng/dL. Normal ranges differ depending on the laboratory used so be sure to discuss with your doctor what is the appropriate normal range for the lab where the test was done. If your testosterone level is low,\n it is important to re-test the level to determine if a lab error or just a daily variation has occurred. The amount of testosterone varies at different times of the day so this is a blood test that needs to be repeated before making medical decisions. It is always important to make sure lab tests correlates with your symptoms. Low testosterone levels in men causes decreased sexual desire,\n erectile dysfunction,\n and infertility. However,\n testosterone also has other important functions. It affects behavior,\n muscle mass,\n and bone density. Therefore a man with low testosterone can develop osteoporosis. Finally in understanding testosterone levels,\n your doctor needs to determine whether the root of the problem is a result of a problem in the testicles,\n where testosterone is produced,\n or if there is a problem in the part of the brain that controls the production of testosterone. Measuring LH and FSH,\n hormones produced in the pituitary of the brain,\n will help make that distinction. Once this information is available,\n your doctor can decide how you need to be treated. Testosterone replacement in the form of a patch,\n gel,\n or injection is usually given. But as with all medications,\n there are cautions. Testosterone can increase the size of the prostate and may cause worsening symptoms in men with benign prostatic hypertrophy and aggravate prostate cancer. So talk with your doctor to understand your test and his concerns.

Very simply,\n pregnancy occurs when a male's sperm fertilizes a female's egg. This occurs when a man ejaculates semen,\n which contains sperm,\n into a woman's vagina. The sperm then move into the uterus,\n where they fertilize an egg if they find one. If a man ejaculates into a woman's rectum during anal sex,\n no pregnancy can occur since human eggs only reside in a woman's reproductive tract. However,\n because the anus and the vaginal opening are located close to each other,\n it's possible  though unlikely -- semen could inadvertently be deposited near the vaginal opening,\n which could lead to pregnancy. For example,\n if a man ejaculates outside the rectum during anal sex,\n the semen could be deposited on the woman's vulva (the outer area of the vagina). If any of this semen made its way into the vagina,\n the sperm could possibly make its way into the uterus and fertilize an egg. However,\n this scenario is unlikely. The odds of a single sperm fertilizing an egg are low even when semen is deposited directly into the vagina. It's even less likely a sperm residing outside the vagina would be successful.

I'm sure we've all wondered this from time to time. The fancy medical term for this condition is \"gustatory rhinitis.\" \"Gustatory\" means \"related to eating,\n\" and \"rhinitis\" just means \"runny nose.\" Gustatory rhinitis has nothing to do with allergies,\n which also can cause a runny nose. Gustatory rhinitis is triggered by eating hot or spicy foods. One study reported about 70% of test subjects said they'd experienced at least one episode of a runny nose while eating. Not surprisingly,\n hot chili peppers ranked as the biggest trigger for gustatory rhinitis. It's unclear why certain foods cause our nose to run when we eat,\n however. One study cited the stimulation of \"atropine-inhibitable muscarinic receptors\" as the cause. But that's hard to explain in a short answer like this.

In the United States,\n heavy alcohol consumption and chronic hepatitis C have been the most common causes of cirrhosis. Obesity is becoming a common cause of cirrhosis,\n either as the sole cause or in combination with alcohol,\n hepatitis C,\n or both. Many people with cirrhosis have more than one cause of liver damage. Cirrhosis is not caused by trauma to the liver or other acute,\n or short-term,\n causes of damage. Usually years of chronic injury are required to cause cirrhosis. Alcohol-related liver disease . Most people who consume alcohol do not suffer damage to the liver. But heavy alcohol use over several years can cause chronic injury to the liver. The amount of alcohol it takes to damage the liver varies greatly from person to person. For women,\n consuming two to three drinksincluding beer and wineper day and for men,\n three to four drinks per day,\n can lead to liver damage and cirrhosis. In the past,\n alcohol-related cirrhosis led to more deaths than cirrhosis due to any other cause. Deaths caused by obesity-related cirrhosis are increasing. Chronic hepatitis C . The hepatitis C virus is a liver infection that is spread by contact with an infected person's blood. Chronic hepatitis C causes inflammation and damage to the liver over time that can lead to cirrhosis. Chronic hepatitis B and D . The hepatitis B virus is a liver infection that is spread by contact with an infected person's blood,\n semen,\n or other body fluid. Hepatitis B,\n like hepatitis C,\n causes liver inflammation and injury that can lead to cirrhosis. The hepatitis B vaccine is given to all infants and many adults to prevent the virus. Hepatitis D is another virus that infects the liver and can lead to cirrhosis,\n but it occurs only in people who already have hepatitis B. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) . In NAFLD,\n fat builds up in the liver and eventually causes cirrhosis. This increasingly common liver disease is associated with obesity,\n diabetes,\n protein malnutrition,\n coronary artery disease,\n and corticosteroid medications. Autoimmune hepatitis . This form of hepatitis is caused by the body's immune system attacking liver cells and causing inflammation,\n damage,\n and eventually cirrhosis. Researchers believe genetic factors may make some people more prone to autoimmune diseases. About 70 percent of those with autoimmune hepatitis are female. Diseases that damage or destroy bile ducts . Several different diseases can damage or destroy the ducts that carry bile from the liver,\n causing bile to back up in the liver and leading to cirrhosis. In adults,\n the most common condition in this category is primary biliary cirrhosis,\n a disease in which the bile ducts become inflamed and damaged and,\n ultimately,\n disappear. Secondary biliary cirrhosis can happen if the ducts are mistakenly tied off or injured during gallbladder surgery. Primary sclerosing cholangitis is another condition that causes damage and scarring of bile ducts. In infants,\n damaged bile ducts are commonly caused by Alagille syndrome or biliary atresia,\n conditions in which the ducts are absent or injured. Inherited diseases . Cystic fibrosis,\n alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency,\n hemochromatosis,\n Wilson disease,\n galactosemia,\n and glycogen storage diseases are inherited diseases that interfere with how the liver produces,\n processes,\n and stores enzymes,\n proteins,\n metals,\n and other substances the body needs to function properly. Cirrhosis can result from these conditions. Drugs,\n toxins,\n and infections . Other causes of cirrhosis include drug reactions,\n prolonged exposure to toxic chemicals,\n parasitic infections,\n and repeated bouts of heart failure with liver congestion.

Glucose,\n an important source of energy for the body,\n comes from food. Carbohydrates are the main dietary source of glucose. Rice,\n potatoes,\n bread,\n tortillas,\n cereal,\n milk,\n fruit,\n and sweets are all carbohydrate-rich foods. After a meal,\n glucose is absorbed into the bloodstream and carried to the body's cells. Insulin,\n a hormone made by the pancreas,\n helps the cells use glucose for energy. If a person takes in more glucose than the body needs at the time,\n the body stores the extra glucose in the liver and muscles in a form called glycogen. The body can use glycogen for energy between meals. Extra glucose can also be changed to fat and stored in fat cells. Fat can also be used for energy. When blood glucose begins to fall,\n glucagon-another hormone made by the pancreas-signals the liver to break down glycogen and release glucose into the bloodstream. Blood glucose will then rise toward a normal level. In some people with diabetes,\n this glucagon response to hypoglycemia is impaired and other hormones such as epinephrine,\n also called adrenaline,\n may raise the blood glucose level. But with diabetes treated with insulin or pills that increase insulin production,\n glucose levels can't easily return to the normal range. Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly. It is usually mild and can be treated quickly and easily by eating or drinking a small amount of glucose-rich food. If left untreated,\n hypoglycemia can get worse and cause confusion,\n clumsiness,\n or fainting. Severe hypoglycemia can lead to seizures,\n coma,\n and even death. In adults and children older than 10 years,\n hypoglycemia is uncommon except as a side effect of diabetes treatment. Hypoglycemia can also result,\n however,\n from other medications or diseases,\n hormone or enzyme deficiencies,\n or tumors.

In your situation,\n what you're doing is actually something we call \"eating around the addiction\". You did well to eliminate refined and processed sugar from your dietary intake. However,\n you didn't replace it with rewarding and tasty enough sweetness from natural sources,\n and thus you're still in crave mode. You want the sweet but can't eat it so you eat around it by continuously munching on other foods. One problem with that,\n in addition to packing on pounds,\n is that you may start getting hooked on the dried fruits and nuts as well. The foods people become most hooked on are called the hyperpalatables--- sugary/fatty/salty food combos. It's never tuna on a bed of greens that we get hooked on. It's the super rewarding hyperpalatables,\n most of which are refined and processed foods. In my book,\n The Hunger Fix,\n I note that you need a strategy of detox and recovery,\n in which you substitute the refined sweets with natural sweets,\n as well as add other foods that naturally boost the brain's dopamine,\n the reward brain chemical that gives you pleasure and satisfaction.

Well,\n you can get out of a bad marriage. I've been aware of my disorder for five years now,\n and I'm 35,\n so this is as far as my experience goes. I don't know how I will be at 40,\n 50,\n 60. But from the way it looks now,\n my strategies will have to change and become more potent if I am to survive. It is LITERALLY a constant battle,\n except that your sworn enemy and foe is INSIDE YOUR HEAD. And it's SMART. It's similar to our smartphones and apps now,\n the ones that \"learn\" your search preferences,\n and even your voice,\n over time. It finds a way to use your own thoughts against you. For example,\n if I am going through a mixed manic-depressive episode,\n I believe (with ALL my heart!) that no one loves me,\n that I am a failure,\n that I will never be ok and that I should just take myself out. It is literally temporary insanity! I am a healthy,\n vibrant,\n attractive,\n career-oriented single mother of a beautiful daughter,\n with a fully loving and supportive family,\n a therapist who loves me and stays on standby,\n and I have goals. I am a normal person. But during those times,\n I am absolutely certain that I am alone,\n that I will fail at my goals like so many times before,\n and that I have no reason to go on living. Its the disease. It talks to me in my head and it's hard to differentiate between the sane voice and the insane one,\n until the episode is over. Then I'm perfectly ok. Just like that. Lastly,\n things that are affected over time are relationships with friends,\n family and romantic relationships,\n and jobs. We struggle with dealing with ourselves,\n so of course others who have to deal with us struggle too. I have had to re-start my career 3 times because I would build up a great rep at a job,\n and then eventually get fired for emotional instability. So that's where the \"failure\" thoughts come from - how do I know it won't happen again? Just yesterday I couldn't stop crying for four hours AT WORK,\n even while interacting with my co-workers. I cannot control or guide when or how intense it will be when it hits. Hope this helps!
